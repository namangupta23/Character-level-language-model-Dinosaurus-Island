# Character-level-language-model-Dinosaurus-Island

This notebook is a programming exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai. In this notebook, we&#39;ll generate dinosaur names that can be given to new breeds of dinosaurs if discovered. We have a dataset of all dinosaur names.  To create new dinosaur names, we will build a character level language model to generate new names. Our algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names.

By completing this notebook, we will learn:

- How to store text data for processing using an RNN
- How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit
- How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network
- Why clipping the gradients is important?
